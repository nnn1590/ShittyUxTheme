# ShittyUxTheme

## About

A file patching UxTheme patcher. If you don't intentionally seek this, I recommend using [SecureUxTheme](https://github.com/namazso/SecureUxTheme) instead.

## Features

* Patches system files
* Probably breaks your install on Windows update
* Grabs patch sites from Microsoft symbols
* Compatible Windows XP -> Windows 11 (and probably future versions)
* Does patches same way as UltraUxThemePatcher
* x86, x64, ARM64 supported
* Easy to embed into silent installers

## Usage

1. Compile for your architecture
2. Put the files `dbghelp.dll`, `symsrv.dll`, `symsrv.yes` and `api-ms-win-downlevel-kernel32-l2-1-0.dll` from Windows 10 SDK(e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64`) next to the output binary
After this, directory structure will be:
```
a_directory
|-- api-ms-win-downlevel-kernel32-l2-1-0.dll
|-- dbghelp.dll
|-- ShittyUxTheme.exe
|-- symsrv.dll
`-- symsrv.yes
```
(or add `Windows 10 SDK\Debuggers\(arch)` to your PATH)
3. Run as Administrator

## Uninstall

1. Go to `%windir%\System32`
2. Replace the dll files starting with these with `.bak(unixtime)` of the same name: `themeui` `themeservice` `UXInit` `uxtheme`
